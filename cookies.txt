Total Time: 11m
Yield: 11-14 cookies

Ingredients
1 cup white, oat, or spelt flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar
1/3 cup chocolate chips
2 tbsp milk of choice, plus more if needed
2 tbsp oil
1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract

Instructions
Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl.
Stir in wet to form a dough.
Keep stirring until a cookie-dough texture is achieved.
If needed, add 1-2 tbsp extra milk of choice.
Form into one big ball.
Either refrigerate at least 2 hours or freeze until the dough is cold.
Once dough is chilled, preheat oven to 325 F.
Form dough balls, and place on a greased baking tray.
Leave enough room between cookies for them to spread.
Bake 11 minutes on the center rack.
Theyâ€™ll look underdone when you take them out.
Let them cool on the baking tray 10 minutes before touching.
